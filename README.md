# scape

An R package with geospatial landscape convenience routines that I use in teaching Landscape Genetics and Landscape Ecology at the Center for Environmental Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University.

To install this package, you must first have the `devtools` package.

```
devtools::install_github("dyerlab/scape")
```
